    Plot
    <br>
    In 17th century Malabar, Thevan and Koran escape the clutches of the Portuguese slave trade in Ponnani and flee to the east. At night, they camp at the banks of the Bharathappuzha River, but Koran is killed by a Yakshi. Thevan runs away, discovering an abandoned mana in the morning. While stealing a coconut, he is apprehended by the house's cook. He is brought before the lord of the mana, Kodumon Potti, who asks his whereabouts and upon learning he is a Paanan, requests him to sing a song.
    <br>
    He compliments Thevan on the song and insists that he stay the night, despite his desire to leave. The cook, while showing Thevan his room, discourages him from asking questions about the house or the Lord's background. Over the next few days, he discovers from the cook that the Potti is a descendant of Chudalan Potti, who was gifted a demon helper, a Chathan, by the goddess Varahi. His constant torture of the Chathan turned it lunatic, and it went on to kill Chudalan Potti and his family. Kodumon Potti eventually defeated the Chathan and chained him in the mansion's attic.
    <br>
    One day, Thevan sees the cook digging a grave in the backyard, presumably for himself. Terrified, he tries to leave, but is unable to. He then realizes that he has lost his memory and that he has been trapped in the manor for months. The cook tells Thevan that the grave is not meant for him, but for Kodumon; the Kodumon downstairs is in fact the Chathan in disguise, and he imprisoned the real Kodumon in the attic and drove him insane, leading to his eventual death. The only way that the cook and Thevan could escape the manor is by defeating the Chathan by dousing an ever-burning lamp located in a secret chamber in the granary, and then trapping it in a special chest.
    <br>
    During an argument, the cook steals the key to the chamber from the Chathan's waist. He opens the chamber and blows out the lamp, rendering the Chathan weak. Thevan and the cook set fire to the Chathan's disguised form, and the creature inside emerges. The cook, now revealed to be Kodumon's illicit son, attempts to put on the ring that will give him command over the Chathan and take over the mana, but is stopped by Thevan, who believes that the ring's power will corrupt him. The two start fighting while the fire destroys the manor and it collapses over them.
    <br>
    Thevan is shown walking away from the ruins of the mana but is attacked by the cook. During the struggle the cook realizes that he is not the real Thevan, but the Chathan in disguise. The real Thevan is then shown to have died as a result of the mana collapsing. Terrified, the cook runs away into the forest and comes across a Portuguese soldier while crossing a river. Thinking that it is one of the Chathan's tricks, he tries to attack the soldier but gets gunned down. A battalion of Portuguese soldiers emerge from the forest, cross the river, and march towards the now destroyed manor, while the Chathan is seen walking through the forest, wearing the ring.
