and their involvement in all stages of execution of the project shall be ensured by the guide.
Project evaluation by the guide: 30 Marks. This mark shall be awarded to the students in his/her
group by considering the following aspects:
Topic Selection: innovativeness, social relevance etc. (2)
Problem definition: Identification of the social, environmental and ethical issues of the project
problem. (2)
Purpose and need of the project: Detailed and extensive explanation of the purpose and need of
the project. (3)
Project Objectives: All objectives of the proposed work are well defined; Steps to be followed to
solve the defined problem are clearly specified. (2)
Project Scheduling & Distribution of Work among Team members: Detailed and extensive
Scheduling with timelines provided for each phase of project. Work breakdown structure well
defined. (3)
Literature survey: Outstanding investigation in all aspects. (4)
Student’s Diary/ Daily Log: The main purpose of writing daily diary is to cultivate the habit of
documenting and to encourage the students to search for details. It develops the students’ thought
process and reasoning abilities. The students should record in the daily/weekly activity diary the
day to day account of the observations, impressions, information gathered and suggestions given,
if any. It should contain the sketches & drawings related to the observations made by the students.
The daily/weekly activity diary shall be signed after every day/week by the guide. (7)
Individual Contribution: The contribution of each student at various stages. (7)</p>
